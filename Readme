    Sda - brainfuck interpreter

    Brainfuck interpreter implemented in x86 for the seek of learning
    and fun, i'd say it is the fastest brainfuck interpreter out there
    but i have no idea since i did not compare it with others and i probably won't.

    All information for this implementation and the programs to test the interpreter
    was taken from https://brainfuck.org/ so thank you Daniel for the information and
    the crazy programs.
